# Task2
To run the test Selenium WebDriver as well as Python needs to be installed. I set Python 3.9 as project interpreter.
I'm using PyCharm IDE, so I'm running test by right click on test_task2.py file and choosing run.
Project was done with page object model usage to avoid repeating code in the future. Every page object includes selectors 
within methods appropriate for each webpage. Methods are called from the test file level in order corresponding 
to the next test steps.
